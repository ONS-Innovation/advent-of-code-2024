# Jack cheats at Advent of Code

I've not yet caught the habit of using chat-style code assistants, so let's give it a go. I don't expect to do many days but I'll make sure I don't do the current day to try to avoid climbing leaderboards...

My goal is not to write any code myself and (in true Advent of Code spirit...) to spend as little time as possible understanding the problem/reading code to identify bugs.

Using ChatGPT-4o.

## Log

| Day    | Part 1 solved | Part 1 prompts | Part 2 solved | Part 2 prompts | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ----| ---- |  ----------- |
| 1  | ✅ | 3 | ✅ | 1 | Had to prompt it to write something to load the input file, and then tell it the input file format. Otherwise solved it without issues. |
| 2  |  ✅ | 3 | ✅ | 1 | Solved without additional prompting. Additional part 1 prompts me hitting enter too soon and forgetting to tell it to load the input file again. |
| 3  | ✅ | 1 | ✅ | 3 | Had to read the task and the code to get it to solve part 2, what a drag. There was a logic issue that it was able to fix when I pointed out the problem. It didn't change anything between the first 2 prompts (when I only told it the output was wrong, not the potential cause). |

## Misc

- Days 1 and 2 I have no idea what the problem or solution actually were, purely hands over to ChatGPT.
